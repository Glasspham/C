Problem I. Segment with small Spread
Given an array of n integers ai. Let's say that a segment of this array a[l .. r] (1≤l<r≤n) is
good if the difference between the maximum and minimum elements on this segment is at
most k. Your task is to find the number of different good segments.
Input
The first line contains integers n and k (1≤n≤10^5, 0≤k≤10^18). The second line contains
integers ai (1≤ai≤10^18).
Output
Print the number of good segments.
Example
Input
7 3
2 6 4 3 6 8 9
Output
16
