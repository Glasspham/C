Problem C. Number of Equal
You are given two arrays aa and bb, sorted in non-decreasing order. Find the number of
pairs (i,j) for which ai=bj.
Input
The first line contains integers nn and mm, the sizes of the arrays (1≤n,m≤105). The
second line contains n integers ai, elements of the first array, the third line
contains m integers bi, elements of the second array (-10^9≤ai,bi≤10^9).
Output
Print one number, the answer to the problem.
Example
Input
