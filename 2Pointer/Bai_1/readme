Problem A. Merging arrays
You are given two arrays, sorted in non-decreasing order. Merge them into one sorted
array.
Input
The first line contains integers n and m, the sizes of the arrays (1≤n,m≤105). The second
line contains n integers ai, elements of the first array, the third line contains m integers bi,
elements of the second array (-10^9≤ai,bi≤10^9).
Output
Print n+m integers, the merged array.
Example
Input
67
1 69 13 18 18
2 3 8 13 15 21 25
Output
1 2 3 68 9 13 13 15 18 18 21 25
