Problem D. Segment With Small Sum
Given an array of n integers ai. Let's say that the segment of this array a[1 .. r] (1≤l≤r≤n) is
good if the sum of elements on this segment is at most s. Your task is to find the longest
good segment.
Input
The first line contains integers nn and s (1≤n≤10^5, 1≤s≤10^18). The second line contains
integers ai (1≤ai≤10^9).
Output
Print one integer, the length of the longest good segment. If there are no such segments,
print -1.
