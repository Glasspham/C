Problem H. Segments with small set
Given an array of n integers ai. Let's say that a segment of this array a[l .. r] (1≤l≤r≤n) is
good if there are no more than k unique elements on this segment. Your task is to find the
number of different good segments.
Input
The first line contains integers n and k (1≤n≤10^5, 0<k≤n). The second line contains
integers ai (1≤ai≤10^5).
Output
Print one integer, the number of good segments.
Example
Input
7 3
2 6 4 3 6 8 3
Output
20
