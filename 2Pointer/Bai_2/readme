Problem B. Number of smaller
You are given two arrays, sorted in non-decreasing order. For each element of the second
array, find the number of elements in the first array strictly less than it.
Input
The first line contains integers nn and mm, the sizes of the arrays (1≤n,m≤10^5). The
second line contains n integers ai, elements of the first array, the third line
contains m integers bi, elements of the second array (-10^9≤ai,bi≤10^9).
Output
Print m numbers, the number of elements of the first array less than each of the elements
of the second array.
Example
Input
6 7
1 6 9 13 18 18
2 3 8 13 15 21 25
Output
1 1 2 3 4 6 6
