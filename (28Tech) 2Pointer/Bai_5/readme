Problem E. Segment With big Sum
Given an array of n integers aiai. Let's say that the segment of this array a[1 .. r] (1≤l<r≤n)
is good if the sum of elements on this segment is at least s. Your task is to find the
shortest good segment.
Input
The first line contains integers n and s (1≤n≤10^5, 1≤s≤10^18). The second line contains
integers ai (1≤ai≤10^9).
Output
Print one integer, the length of the shortest good segment. If there are no such segments,
print -1.
Example
Input
7 20
2 6 4 3 6 8 9
Output
3
