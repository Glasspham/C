Problem G. Number of Segments with big sum
Given an array of n integers ai. Let's say that the segment of this array a[l .. r] (1≤lr≤n) is
good if the sum of elements on this segment is at least s. Your task is to find the number
of good segments.
Input
The first line contains integers n and s (1≤n≤10^5, 1≤s≤10^18). The second line contains
integers ai (1≤ai≤10^9).
Output
Print one integer, the number of good segments.
Example
Input
7 20
2 6 4 3 6 8 9
Output
9
